# Dataset FAQ for the M-CHAIN Evaluation

This FAQ answers common questions about the datasets used in the M‑CHAIN evaluation.  
It explains what the datasets contain, why they were chosen, how they are fetched, and why the dataset repositories remain at their official research sources.

---

## 1. Why are the datasets not stored directly in this repository?

The datasets used in M‑CHAIN are **large public datasets**, and they must remain at their **official sources** for licensing, maintenance, and version‑tracking reasons.

Official dataset sources:
- SmartBugs Curated (labeled contracts)  
  https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-curated [1](https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-curated)  
- SmartBugs Wild (~47k real‑world contracts)  
  https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-wild [2](https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-wild)  
- SWC Registry test cases  
  https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/SWC-registry [3](https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/SWC-registry)

These repositories are publicly available, and SmartBugs documentation provides details on dataset composition and usage.  
Reference: https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs/blob/master/doc/datasets.md [4](https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs/blob/master/doc/datasets.md)

This repository contains **pointers**, pinned commit hashes, and scripts—not the datasets themselves.

## 2. How do I download all the datasets?

Run the PowerShell script provided (`get_datasets.ps1`) or use the commands below:

```powershell
cd C:\mchain-data
git clone https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-curated.git       # Curated  [1](https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-curated)
git clone https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-wild.git          # Wild     [2](https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-wild)
git clone https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/SWC-registry.git # SWC      [3](https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/SWC-registry)
