ode of Conduct

This Code of Conduct governs interactions within the **M‑CHAIN Dataset Manifest** repository.  
This repository provides documentation, manifest files, and reproducibility guidance for working with public datasets such as:

- SmartBugs Curated (labeled benchmark) [1](https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-curated)  
- SmartBugs Wild (~47k real-world contracts) [2](https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-wild)  
- SWC Registry (canonical vulnerability test cases) [3](https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/SWC-registry)  

SmartBugs documentation also describes dataset structure and usage.

The purpose of this repository is to support reproducible academic work through accurate metadata and documentation.  
We expect all contributors and users to engage constructively, respectfully, and responsibly.

---

## 1. Our Commitment

We commit to maintaining an open, inclusive, and respectful environment for all contributors.  
All interactions should reflect:

- Respect  
- Professionalism  
- Clarity  
- Constructive collaboration  
- Academic integrity  

We welcome contributions that improve documentation, scripts, metadata, or reproducibility clarity.

## 2. Expected Behavior

All participants are expected to:

1. **Be respectful and considerate**  
   Treat others with respect. Avoid personal attacks and dismissive language.

2. **Communicate clearly**  
   Keep discussions focused on improving reproducibility, documentation, and metadata.

3. **Follow dataset usage rules**  
   Datasets referenced in this repository must be fetched from their **official sources**, such as SmartBugs Curated, SmartBugs Wild, and SWC Registry.  
   These datasets must not be re-uploaded here.  
   (SmartBugs documentation confirms dataset licensing and distribution rules.)

4. **Keep contributions lightweight**  
   Only metadata and documentation should be added.  
   No Solidity files or dataset contents should be uploaded.

5. **Provide accurate information**  
   When submitting changes, ensure commit hashes, links, and instructions are correct.

---

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not allowed:

- Harassment, discrimination, or disrespectful communication  
- Uploading copyrighted, licensed, or proprietary dataset files  
- Uploading Solidity contracts from:
  - SmartBugs Curated [1](https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-curated)  
  - SmartBugs Wild [2](https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-wild)  
  - SWC Registry test cases [3](https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/SWC-registry)  
- Sharing misleading or unsafe reproducibility instructions  
- Posting private information or security‑sensitive data  
- Attempting to redistribute dataset contents that must remain at their official sources  
- Fraudulent authorship, plagiarism, or misattribution  

---

## 4. Reporting Issues or Misconduct

If you observe a violation of this Code of Conduct:

- Open an **Issue** in the repository  
- Include:
  - A concise summary  
  - Steps to reproduce the issue  
  - Relevant file names or links  

If the issue is sensitive or personal, contact the maintainer through the email listed on the GitHub profile.

---

## 5. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- All interactions on GitHub Issues and Pull Requests  
- Discussions, feedback, and review comments  
- All contributions, including documentation updates, script changes, and manifest improvements  

This repository is **metadata‑only** and does not contain executable smart contracts.  
Security issues related to dataset contents should be reported to the official SmartBugs or SWC repositories.

---

## 6. Enforcement

The maintainer will review reports and take appropriate action, which may include:

- Informal clarification  
- Rejection of problematic contributions  
- Rewriting inaccurate or unsafe instructions  
- Temporary or permanent removal from participation  

Actions are taken at the maintainer’s discretion.

---

## 7. Acknowledgment

This Code of Conduct draws inspiration from academic and open-source community guidelines.  
It is tailored to support reproducibility and documentation standards for datasets widely used in smart‑contract research, as described in SmartBugs resources and SWC Registry materials.

## 8. Contact

For questions, clarifications, or to report an issue, please contact the M‑CHAIN project maintainer through GitHub.
