# Folder Structure for the M-CHAIN Dataset Environment

This document describes the folder layout used for downloading and organizing the datasets required to reproduce the M‑CHAIN experiments.  
The structure mirrors the layout referenced in the thesis and in Appendix D.

The datasets remain at their **official sources** (SmartBugs Curated, SmartBugs Wild, SWC Registry).  
We clone only the repositories and use commit hashes for reproducibility.
